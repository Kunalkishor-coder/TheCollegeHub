    <h1 class="mt-5">Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services over the internet. It offers a flexible and scalable solution for storing, managing, and processing data without requiring on-premises infrastructure.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Advantages of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Scalability: Easily scale computing resources up or down based on demand.</li>
      <li>Cost-Efficiency: Pay only for the resources you use, reducing upfront costs.</li>
      <li>Reliability: Cloud service providers offer high availability and redundancy.</li>
      <li>Flexibility: Access data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection.</li>
      <li>Security: Cloud providers implement advanced security measures to protect data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Cloud Service Models</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including virtual machines, storage, and networks.</li>
      <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> Offers a platform and environment for developers to build and deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.</li>
      <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for installation and maintenance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Cloud Deployment Models</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public Cloud:</strong> Services are provided over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to use them.</li>
      <li><strong>Private Cloud:</strong> Services are dedicated to a single organization and may be managed internally or by a third-party.</li>
      <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud:</strong> Combines public and private clouds, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of both.</li>
    </ul>
